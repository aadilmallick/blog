## Intro

### MED

The most important principle when it comes to learning anything or becoming stronger in anything is the **minimum effective dose** (MED) which is the minimum amount of stuff you need in order to assert an effect:

- The MED for boiled water is 212F - no need to boil to 250F.

>“REMEMBER: it is impossible to evaluate, or even understand, anything that you cannot measure.”

### The 4 rules of habit change

1. **Make it conscious**: By making behaviors conscious, you are more likely to stop in the act.
2. **Make it a game**: Challenge yourself to have a good diet, good workout, x times in a row. This will make it a habit.
3. **Make it competitive**: Compete in a challenge with others.
4. **Make it small and temporary**: Ask yourself, what is the smallest meaningful change I can make?

**make it conscious**

The best way to make a bad habit like bad eating conscious is to take a photo of every meal you are going to eat. 

- If you take a photo of an M&M milkshake before you drink it, and realize all your meals for the day were utter junk, it will cause you to rethink what you're eating and make it more conscious.


> [!NOTE] 
> App idea: create a mobile app that forces users to take photos of their meals everyday and then uses AI summary to tell whether they had a good day of eating or not, and how to improve their eating habits. The purpose of this app is to make users conscious about what they are eating. When taking a photo of an oreo milkshake for example, the AI overlay will estimate how many calories and show a health score encouraging or discouraging the meal.



The second best way to make bad-eating conscious is to take a **before** photo and place it somewhere unavoidable on the fridge so you can look at it and be reminded of how much you want to change.

In summary, here are the two things you can do:

- [ ] Take a before photo of your fatass body and print them out and put them in obvious and unavoidable places you'll see all the time.
- [ ] Take a photo of each meal before you eat it.

**make it a game**

Challenge yourself to do something 5 times in a row, which will make it a habit.

>Aristotle had it right, but he was missing a number: “We are what we do repeatedly.” A mere five times (five workouts, five meals, five of whatever we want) will be our goal.

- [ ] Challenge yourself to go to the gym 5 times in a row
- [ ] Challenge yourself to count calories 5 days in a row
- [ ] Challenge yourself to weigh yourself 5 days in a row
- [ ] Challenge yourself to not eat junk food 5 days in a row

### The importance of tracking

Simply being aware of how much you're eating and what weight you are at will cause your brain to subconsciously lower your weight. If you don't track anything, you won't succeed.

### The art of reinventing yourself

Losing weight or building muscle makes you an overall better human being because it's something measurable, something you can control. It opens you up to new possibilities and makes you realize you can achieve anything if you put your mind to it.

>Controlling your body puts you in life’s driver’s seat

>“What’s the fastest way for someone to improve their inner game?” To which I responded: “Improve your outer game.”


## Losing weight

### Slow-carb diet

1. Avoid white carbs: white bread, white rice, pasta, potatoes, cereal, tortillas, fried food, even oatmeal.
2. Do not drink diet drinks: all diet drinks have fructose-based ways to sweeten your drink, so they will induce weight gain. Splenda also kills all the good bacteria in your stomach.
3. Avoid fruits and fruit juices: fructose induces weight gain, so don't do it. 
4. Avoid dairy: dairy products promote insulin, which inhibits fat loss. The only exception to this is cottage cheese.
5. Have a cheat day once a week where you eat at least 1000 calories above maintenance: this is to prevent your metabolism from crashing. You can eat as many carbs as you want, and any type.

Here are the foods you can eat on the slow-carb diet:

- leafy vegetables
- tomato, avocado, mushroom
- legumes (lentils, beans)
- egg whites, eggs, chiecken, beef, fish
- non-starchy vegetables: broccoli, cauliflower, peas
- cottage cheese

The reason why you don't want to drink fruit juice or eat any fruits, is because fructose increases iron absorption, which is toxic for men since they can't menstruate to get rid of iron from their bloodstream. Also, fructose stores fat.

You can't drink milk either because it causes insulin to store fat.

**A great cheat trick**

The best cheat trick to avoid cravings is that whenever you get a craving to eat something, write it down as something you will eat during your cheat day. It becomes deferred eating and you look forward to it on that day.

**the main vitamins to eat**

During this diet, you should make sure you get ample potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Here are the food sources that do so:

- **potassium**: Avocado, 1 cup of spinach, pinto beans, black beans, mushrooms, salmon
- **magnesium**: Magnesium pill, pumpkin speeds, spinach
- **calcium**: salmon, tofu, spinach

**three main tips to adhere to**

1. Eat 30g of protein within 30 minutes of waking. You can use a protein shake to achieve this.
2. Do not overinduldge in the allowed fatty foods of legumes, like peanuts, beans, or lentils, since they are high calorie.

### Minimize the effects of binging

Insulin release is minimized by blunting sharp jumps in blood sugar. Even if you binge, there are techniques you can use to prevent absorption of those calories. 

1. Ensure that your first meal of the day is actually healthy and not a binge meal. Get 30g of protein for breakfast and a lot of fiber to prevent diarrhea
2. Drink grapefruit juice with coffee
3. Use supplements that increase insulin sensitivity: green tea extract and garlic
4. Consume citric juices, like stuff with lemon and lime.
5. Consume 100-200mg caffeine before every meal to induce diarrhea

To promote GLUT-4, which puts calories into muscle instead of fat, perform several bodyweight exercises per day. Do it before and after each meal.

- Do 60-90 seconds of pushups before each meal
- Do 60-90 seconds of squats after each meal

### Other diet tips

1. Avoid zero-cal sweeteners. They only induce weight gain due to being fructose-based and they kill of the good bacteria in the gut.
2. Eat fermented foods like Sauerkraut, Kimchi, and yogurt, as these promote the good gut bacteria.

### Cold-exposure for fat loss

Swimming burns a lot more calories than normal because of physics. Doing stuff like cold exposure makes your body's brown adipose tissue force fat burning. The most important thing here is to induce shivering, since that's where fat loss actually starts. Here are some protocols you can do:

- 5-10 min cold showers in the morning
- Do swimming to take advantage of thermogenesis.

### Increase testosterone

To increase testosterone, do the following:

- Get sufficient Vitamin D a day. Get 5000 IU to start
- 6 brazil nuts a day. 3 when waking, 3 before sleeping.
- cod liver oil

Here is also a good testosterone cocktail:

- 1.5 cups fat free milk
- 2 egg whites
- 3 tablespoon chia seeds
- 4 tablespoons pb2
- cinnamon
