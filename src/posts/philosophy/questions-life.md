## Build yourself up

### Reach into your cookie jar

This is an idea I got from David Goggins. He calls this exercise the **cookie jar**, because, well, you reach into your cookie jar and pull out a cookie. I'm just kidding.

When we do productive things day in, day out, we tend to raise the goalposts higher and higher. We eventually find ourselves stressed and get stuck a routine that isn't even benefitting ourselves. We beat ourselves up even more for not sticking to the plan, even when we hate every minute of a brain-bashing routine.

The solution? Acknowledge your wins. Acknowledge them deeply, so you will always remember them. Our victories and accomplishments are the cookies we can take out from the cookie jar.

Now, I'm not saying treat yourself to relax because you've already accomplished so much. We need those cookies for a reason: when we're in a difficult situation or faced with a giant obstacle we can't overcome, we need to remember the cookie jar and all the cookies in it. The cookies are reminders of when our back was to the wall, when we accomplished something we think we couldn't have ever done.

These cookies aren't just diabetic bundles of chocolatey goodness - they're indicators of change, that you can become a different person than the one you believe yourself to be.

When you don't want to do that last rep, when you don't want to run that last mile, or you don't want to talk to that person, remember those cookies. Pull one of them out, and remind yourself of what you've accomplished and what your potential is.

Here's some of my cookies:

- I finished the La La Land epilogue piano piece even though I've only been playing for 2.5 years. I've made amazing progress. Granted, I can't play through the entire song without making some minor mistakes, but I did it. I may still feel empty inside, but I'll be damned if I didn't do it.

- I used to be so afraid of music theory, but in the first summer of quarantine, I suddenly had the urge to read the _Visually Piano_ book after watching demon slayer and trying to play Gurenge on piano. What followed was a love for music theory. I can't call it passion, because that's not what it was. It was obsession, amusement, wonder. Something I was scared of for so long turned out to be so laughably simple. I understand why things sounded good, and how to make things sound good. I finally understand that a _major scale_ wasn't just a buzzword but a practical thing I could use in my playing. It's like when you learn a new language, and suddenly you can unlock an entire new world of meaning. You could only laugh at how limited your view of life was before.
- I deleted all social media. To be honest, this wasn't that hard, since it's not like I had any friends on there, but I'm still proud of myself. My biggest flaw is that I'm all bark, no bite. A talker and not an actor. A guy who got put on the sex offender registry for peeing outside and not a person who goes into school zones and well ... I'll leave it there. But by deleting social media, I took the first step to take back control of my life. I deleted Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. Maybe you consider YouTube as social media, but come on.
- <strong>I stopped znfgheongvat</strong>. I've been clean for the past 5 months. One constant theme I see throughout anything I accomplish is this: how you feel doesn't really change. Once I think of a change that would be significant to my life, and then I make that change, I realize it didn't really change who I was that much. 5 months in I thought I would start levitating or at least have a million-dollar business, but I guess that was naive.
- Contrary to like 99.9999% of the human population, I actually figured out what I wanted to do with life ever since I was 17. And then I took action. I started researching how to write books, reading _How to write fiction for Dummies_, and I started planning my debut book. After 3 months of knowledge gaining, 3 months of planning, and 3 months of writing, I finished my first draft. In the instant I wrote the last sentence of the manuscript, another cookie plopped into the jar, crumbs cascading down the jar's glass sides. I became a person who could finish things. It's still not done yet, and a major pain point is writing the second draft (which I still haven't started), but I proved something to myself. I can finish things. I can take a step towards my dreams, which is more than what some people have done. Not accomplishing my dreams is anguish, and I can accept that. I choose to work towards that pinnacle of my existence rather than run away and numb myself again. Why? Because of those split moments. Those moments when you turn off the screen, when you stop talking with your friends and lay down to sleep at night alone - those are the brief seconds you can't run away from. Those few seconds of emptiness can ruin even the fullest of days.
- I'm happy with my love of learning. I've never truly let myself indulge in my inner nerd until I started taking coding courses on Udemy. You don't know how great it feels when you wake up in the morning and all you want to do is learn, all you want to do is level up. There's a lot of questions about myself that I don't know how to answer yet, but I think I found out what the greatest feeling in the world is to me. It's the same feeling I get when I learn about derivatives, music theory, and coding, the same joy people feel when the government reveals the existence of UFOs. Like a hidden shell surfacing underneath a pile of sand, rediscovering everyday things in a new light is that ultimate joy. I now see facebook as HTML and CSS connected to a backend rather than plain magic, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Maybe I'm wrong, but the greatest happiness isn't kissing your partner or kid to sleep, but it's that smile you get when you _just can't believe something_. The best smiles are when you're about to burst out laughing. For years, you probably saw something as a certain way, and learning something new changed your perception of that thing forever. You shake your head, smile, and hold in bursts of chuckles. How couldn't you? "It was so simple, all along ..."

I still have a long way to go. If these are my successes, I probably have 10 times the amount of failures. It's not just me. I'll tell people about my life, they'll say I'm exaggerating, I'll deny those claims, and then they say, "damn, you really need to get your life together."

But it's your turn. Maybe your cookies will taste better than mine. You won't know unless you try.
