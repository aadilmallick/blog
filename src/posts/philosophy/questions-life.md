## Build yourself up

### Reach into your cookie jar

This is an idea I got from David Goggins. He calls this exercise the **cookie jar**, because, well, you reach into your cookie jar and pull out a cookie. I'm just kidding.

When we do productive things day in, day out, we tend to raise the goalposts higher and higher. We eventually find ourselves stressed and get stuck a routine that isn't even benefitting ourselves. We beat ourselves up even more for not sticking to the plan, even when we hate every minute of a brain-bashing routine.

The solution? Acknowledge your wins. Acknowledge them deeply, so you will always remember them. Our victories and accomplishments are the cookies we can take out from the cookie jar.

Now, I'm not saying treat yourself to relax because you've already accomplished so much. We need those cookies for a reason: when we're in a difficult situation or faced with a giant obstacle we can't overcome, we need to remember the cookie jar and all the cookies in it. The cookies are reminders of when our back was to the wall, when we accomplished something we think we couldn't have ever done.

These cookies aren't just diabetic bundles of chocolatey goodness - they're indicators of change, that you can become a different person than the one you believe yourself to be.

When you don't want to do that last rep, when you don't want to run that last mile, or you don't want to talk to that person, remember those cookies. Pull one of them out, and remind yourself of what you've accomplished and what your potential is.

Here's some of my cookies:

- I finished the La La Land epilogue piano piece even though I've only been playing for 2.5 years. I've made amazing progress. Granted, I can't play through the entire song without making some minor mistakes, but I did it. I may still feel empty inside, but I'll be damned if I didn't do it.

    </div>

- I used to be so afraid of music theory, but in the first summer of quarantine, I suddenly had the urge to read the _Visually Piano_ book after watching demon slayer and trying to play Gurenge on piano. What followed was a love for music theory. I can't call it passion, because that's not what it was. It was obsession, amusement, wonder. Something I was scared of for so long turned out to be so laughably simple. I understand why things sounded good, and how to make things sound good. I finally understand that a _major scale_ wasn't just a buzzword but a practical thing I could use in my playing. It's like when you learn a new language, and suddenly you can unlock an entire new world of meaning. You could only laugh at how limited your view of life was before.
- I deleted all social media. To be honest, this wasn't that hard, since it's not like I had any friends on there, but I'm still proud of myself. My biggest flaw is that I'm all bark, no bite. A talker and not an actor. A guy who got put on the sex offender registry for peeing outside and not a person who goes into school zones and well ... I'll leave it there. But by deleting social media, I took the first step to take back control of my life. I deleted Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. Maybe you consider YouTube as social media, but come on.
- <strong>I stopped slacking the hogt</strong>. I've been clean for the past 5 months. One constant theme I see throughout anything I accomplish is this: how you feel doesn't really change. Once I think of a change that would be significant to my life, and then I make that change, I realize it didn't really change who I was that much. 5 months in I thought I would start levitating or at least have a million-dollar business, but I guess that was naive.
- Contrary to like 99.9999% of the human population, I actually figured out what I wanted to do with life ever since I was 17. And then I took action. I started researching how to write books, reading _How to write fiction for Dummies_, and I started planning my debut book. After 3 months of knowledge gaining, 3 months of planning, and 3 months of writing, I finished my first draft. In the instant I wrote the last sentence of the manuscript, another cookie plopped into the jar, crumbs cascading down the jar's glass sides. I became a person who could finish things. It's still not done yet, and a major pain point is writing the second draft (which I still haven't started), but I proved something to myself. I can finish things. I can take a step towards my dreams, which is more than what some people have done. Not accomplishing my dreams is anguish, and I can accept that. I choose to work towards that pinnacle of my existence rather than run away and numb myself again. Why? Because of those split moments. Those moments when you turn off the screen, when you stop talking with your friends and lay down to sleep at night alone - those are the brief seconds you can't run away from. Those few seconds of emptiness can ruin even the fullest of days.
- I'm happy with my love of learning. I've never truly let myself indulge in my inner nerd until I started taking coding courses on Udemy. You don't know how great it feels when you wake up in the morning and all you want to do is learn, all you want to do is level up. There's a lot of questions about myself that I don't know how to answer yet, but I think I found out what the greatest feeling in the world is to me. It's the same feeling I get when I learn about derivatives, music theory, and coding, the same joy people feel when the government reveals the existence of UFOs. Like a hidden shell surfacing underneath a pile of sand, rediscovering everyday things in a new light is that ultimate joy. Now instead of seeing Facebook as magic, I see it as HTML and CSS connected to a backend running on PHP with SQL. Maybe I'm wrong, but the greatest happiness isn't kissing your partner or kid to sleep, but it's that smile you get when you _just can't believe something_. The best smiles are when you're about to burst out laughing. For years, you probably saw something as a certain way, and learning something new changed your perception of that thing forever. You shake your head, smile, and hold in bursts of chuckles. How couldn't you? "It was so simple, all along ..."

I still have a long way to go. If these are my successes, I probably have 10 times the amount of failures. It's not just me. I'll tell people about my life, they'll say I'm exaggerating, I'll deny those claims, and then they say, "damn, you really need to get your life together."

But it's your turn. Maybe your cookies will taste better than mine. You won't know unless you try.

### Ideal day

This is simple. What's your ideal day?

- **Morning**: wake up and feel immense joy for being alive another day. Go for a run. Take a shower. Meditate. Start writing a new book that my fans are dying to read, conduct business calls with the shows I'm directing. Cook a healthy breakfast with my world-class cooking skills. Go to the gym, work out hard, do some boxing and swimming. I'll probably be there for 1-2 hours.
- **Afternoon**: Go to the library, read some books, go back home and record One Man Band videos.
- **Evening**: Settle down, have fun. Maybe stream, record more videos, play games, maybe go to the movies once a week.

### Ideal self

I want to be confident, charismatic, and self-assured. I want to be able to express myself artistically, and hopefully people will like my ideas. Even if I live in an apartment for the rest of my life, that doesn't matter. As long as I can do the things I really want to do and live how I want to live, my life will be a success.

I want to enjoy other people's company, but not rely on them. I want to love myself. I'll be an expert programmer as well as an accomplished musician. All my books will have been published and even greenlit into animes, and people will love my stories. They may never know the man behind those shows, those characters, but that's okay. They don't need to know my name. As long as they love my story, I'll feel like I've given my all to the world and they've returned that with enormous appreciation.

I want to move on _past_ my past. I want to believe instead of merely knowing that happiness comes from within, no matter whether you're the 3rd richest man in the world or a kid in Africa traveling 5 miles to the nearest well for clean water. I want to realize that suffering and desire will always be the default of human existence, and I want to move past those vices and accomplish something few people do: overcome their animal instincts and become true humans.

I've always admired characters in manga who chased their goals and purpose above all else, at the cost of their relationships and in some cases, even their own life.

### What do you want to deserve?

Let's talk: what do you want to deserve? What are the things in life you want to come your way? I'll start (but it's not like I expect you respond):

- Confidence. Social charisma.
- Admiration and respect from people.
- A fit body that looks good in the mirror (vain, I know, but what can I say? Read more in [The way](#the-way)).
- 3 books published. _Tomura_ as #1 on MyAnimeList for some time - until FMAB inevitably topples it over. _Time Warriors_ as a gripping American classic, with themes about regret, ambition, and nostalgia. _The Dream_ as a hallmark of how to write an amazing plot twist, with an ending nobody yet everybody saw coming. See more in [The Spill](#the-spill).
- One Man Band at a million subscribers. People love my music covers, and so do I, even if they're hard work. Maybe the summit of mastery is an illusion. Maybe we'll never be satisfied. But we can't know that for sure unless we try to climb that peak in the first place, where then and only then can we stake our flag into the snowy floor and say, "damn, maybe that wasn't worth it after all."
- I want to live my life without a sense of urgency. I want to deserve waking up every day with a smile on my face, as if I was perpetually stuck in a Barbie dollhouse.

#### What can we do to deserve those things?

Self-explanatory. You know what's next.

- **Confidence** : I will talk to strangers, speak spanish with people on Discord, cold email people I want to work with for coding projects, and go to clubs where I'm intimated of the club members, like MSA (they're all so cool and tall). I will go to every MSA meeting and make myself known. The other aspect of confidence - accomplishment - should take care of itself if I am disciplined enough to work on my goals.
- **Admiration** : I will do the tasks that will build up my future. I will code. I will write. I will practice guitar, piano, and bass. I will post videos on YouTube. I must create my own future with my own hands because Mr. Beast will not descend down from the stratosphere to help me.
- **Six pack** : I'm so close. Really. I know getting a 6 pack won't make me feel any less empty inside, but getting a six pack gives me another cookie to add to the cookie jar. For 7 years I've pined over this societally-coveted aesthetic muscle. Now that I have extensive fitness knowledge and have built up decent muscle, I no longer feel this intense need for a six pack nor do I make it out to be this wondrous, elusive thing, but the fact still stands - I never had it. If I can get two additional packs, I can break down this facade of myself, a person who believes he can't change and do the important tasks in life. That's the real aim. The ability to change has always been what I've really wanted.
  - Do things like 10,000 steps a day, fish oil in the morning, abs everyday, cardio 3 times a week. We should be golden.
- **Writing** : Write 1 hour a day. If you're not writing, then revise. This is a non-negotiable. I could use a habit tracker and a schedule to keep me on track.
- **Music** : Practice your damn instruments. It really is that simple dude.
- **Inner Peace** : Meditate everyday. You may never be able to have the happiness of a frat dude taking a girl to his dorm room, but you have to prepare for the challenges of life - and make no mistake, they will come. Find a way to overcome your past regrets and focus only on your mission in life.

## Break yourself down

Now that we've built you up, we have to break you back down. You have to face reality and see your mistakes. This part of the process is all about owning up for our failures, and to see how much failing really pains us.

Yeah, you and I (I'm with you all the way) might feel terrible after this section, but we get back something essential - **control**.

### What you really deserve

Well, that was nice. You wrote down everything you wanted to deserve. Let's take a second to look at our reality: I'm pudgy, below average height, socially anxious and lonely, unsuccessful, and unfulfilled. This exercise confronts you with your own harsh reality, and forces you to see why you're the architect of your own life - whether you want to be or not.

So now let's see what you actually deserve:

- **I deserve to feel bad** : I deserve to feel like a fraud. I told my family and friends I was going to accomplish something in March 2023. It would be big. Little did they know, back then, I was planning to write my debut book _The Dream_. And I actually finished my first draft by December 21st 2022. But then I had nothing to show for it. I didn't revise my novel. I was too scared to. I let fear make me undisciplined and entertainment make me numb. I barely practiced piano and guitar. Yes, there was brain fog, and the feeling of time slipping away, but that was no excuse from slacking off on quite literally the purpose of my life. I know I'm lucky to have these dreams. But they'll end up being a curse for me if I'm too undisciplined to etch them into reality. So yeah, I deserve to feel terrible.
- **I deserve to be fat** : I indulge in junk food and am too lazy to do exercise consistently. I said I'd go to the gym 5 days a week, but it's been at most 2. I know, I know. This is completely normal, but if we look at it from an outsider perspective, you'll see how ridiculous it is to give in to our vices. Imagine a fly watching a human eat a donut. He'd say, "So you're ruining your diet for momentary pleasure, the likes of which that will fade 5.7 seconds after the last bite? Yes, you'll be coping with yourself, saying that 'only one' won't hurt, and while that's true, we both know it's not _only one_. With every cope you take, every diet you forsake, I'll be watching you 🎵. You become weaker each time you indulge in junk food. You start running on a downward slope, where the hill keeps on getting steeper and steeper, until you roll back to square one. You want to change, but you don't realize that indulging even once poisons that change, and with each failed attempt at change, you solidify your identity as a worthless person who can never achieve what they want. Your punishment is stagnancy, complete and utter constancy, the worst of them all." Maybe that's what a fly would say if they could talk.
- **I deserve to not have my dream height** : I've dreamed of becoming taller for so long. I'm self-aware of it being a useless insecurity that holds me back, but I still can't shake it. I don't want to say Freud's right, but when he's right he's right. My insecurity about my height has always been something that held me back. So what did I do? Absolutely nothing. I didn't do the stretches, drink the shakes, or swallow the pills that would have actually helped me grow taller. Of course not. That's too much work, and that much work required discipline - discipline I never had. I've never done anything consistently and I've never done anything at 100%. I could cry about this and say that height is something I can't control, but that's not true. I never really tried. I was so afraid of failure that I half-assed everything, and shocker - I failed.
- **I deserve to be lonely and socially anxious** : What did I do about my lack of friends? Nothing. I didn't reach out to anyone or text anyone first. I always expected them to talk to me. I almost never went out of my way to go to club meetings, but when I did, I discretely ran away whenever I felt awkward or nervous. I tried, but I didn't try hard enough.

### What do you hate about your life

I hate my social anxiety, I hate that my body is not up to my standards, I hate my laziness, but above all, I hate that I am all talk and no action. It's like with every word coming out of my mouth, simply saying it invalidates its chances of becoming reality. I don't need to tell you how scary it is to understand that you're lying to yourself, even when you're not trying to.

### Limiting habits, insecurities, and factors.

What are all the limiting habits, insecurities, and factors in your life that inhibit your potential?

- I am a procrastinator.
- I have a very negative dialogue with myself. I keep putting myself down (rightly so), but science proves optimism gets you closer to your goals.
- Watching tv, watching too much self-improvement youtube. I have to limit distractions. I must become a producer rather than a consumer.
- Insecurity with body. When I'm over 15% body fat, a lot of attention shifts to my stomach rolls and I just feel weird.
- Insecurity with height. It's always controlled my life. It's going to take a lot of work to undo this, and it isn't normal to get rid of your insecurities, but unusual goals such as mine require unusual ways of life. I have to have a unique mindset that can help me overcome all worldly issues.
- Low confidence. Again, I need real world accomplishments and discipline before I can feel proud of myself.

## Course correction

### The Spill

Write three books, _The Dream_ (a sci-fi novel about climbing a tall, mysterious tower to reach heaven), _Time Warriors_ (a sci-fi novel about a man turning back time and reliving his life 5,000 times to erase his regrets), _Tomura_ (a distant sequel to Naruto - wait wait, it's good, I promise).

I want to create One Man Band, where I create covers of my favorite bands by playing the guitar, bass, and piano - hence the name.

I want to be financially free. If I had good social skills, a job would be no problem but I don't want to be locked into that life. I already hate how school takes time away from what really matters to me, so a job would be out of the question.

I want to be tall and fit. Yeah, this is vain, but I guess fixing the problem is easier and cheaper than using therapy to forget about my insecurities.

### Negative thought patterns

- **"I'll always be like this"** : Remind yourself that change is always possible. Brad Traversy changed from a drug addict into the most successful coding youtube of all time. Anyone can change. The only difference between you and them is that they did the work. So what are you waiting for? Do the work.

### Things that make you uncomfortable

To become discipline. We must practice the skill of discipline. Maybe one day I'll create an app to gamify discipline, but for now, just assigning EXP values will do.

- **Physical exercise** : Must be strenuous
  - **Boxing +15exp** : Boxing is the hardest exercise I've done. You're gasping for air at the end, but you gotta keep going.
  - **Running +10exp** : If you run normally, only 5 exp. If you run in public, where you're practicing overcoming your social fears, then it's 10 exp.
- **social activities**
  - **talking to a stranger +30exp**
  - **speaking in spanish on discord +35exp**

### The way

Miyamoto Musashi talks about _The way_, as in your way of life you must follow no matter what. For him, his way was the sword, while mine is the ... pen (everyone in the audience immediately throws up, ambulances are called in, people are crying and dying from cringe).

But how I interpret this concept is that you cna have your own unique path to walk upon. You may see everyone else drive past in a bustling highway, but don't be fooled - this is your path, and you must stick to it.

Of course I can't help but feel lonely when I see kids my age driving to New York with all their friends, having a wacky time as if they were on a vacation arc in the latest Netflix show. Besides the feelings of self-worth and self-love I'd get from being in such a friend group, wouldn't it be nice if everything just _made sense_? To have that first kiss at midnight on the beach and think, _so this is who I'll think of as my first love_. To trespass onto private property with your friends and think, _so these are the people who I'm going to spend the rest of my life with_.

When you never experience any of these things, your life becomes boringly certain. You had a good day today? Or maybe it was bad. Either way, it doesn't matter, because today will be exactly how the rest of your life will go.

I think I'm the first person to coin this term, _Netflix Syndrome_, where we either knowingly or unknowingly try to make our life as close to Netflix drama as possible. Fall madly in love. Fall madly out of love. Get cheated on and be mad. Cheat on them and be mad when they get mad at you. You get my point. The allure of such a showstopping life is because of a perfect mix of certainty and uncertainty, the special spice that makes you want to click the _next episode_ button. Who wouldn't want to wake up in the morning, excited for the next new installment in their totally wacky life?

But I can't have this life. This is the start of my way. When your life itself is a showstopper, you can't create any showstoppers. Correct me if I'm wrong, but do you think Stacy - who gets drunk with her friends at 4 AM, has a great love life with he boyfriend, and has a great job as a consultant - has the motivation to create a timeless story, something that means something? Then compare her to JK Rowling, a lonely, struggling waitress whose manuscript was rejected multiple times, all while providing for her child.

The universe's perfect mathematical balance presents itself in weird ways. You can't do great work if you were the life of the party, nor is it possible for you to be truly present in the whimsical life of a normal person if you do great work. Correct me if I'm wrong though (I'll probably implement a commenting system at some point, but I don't want to use Firebase for everything - sue me).

So no matter how much I want it, I can't have a netflix life. I can live that life vicariously through my stories, but that's about it. Yes, maybe I'm just running away from my social anxiety and regrets, and one day God will resurrect us all from our graves, stand me up on a floating podium, and bellow, "silly fool! The real moral of life was to cherish all your relationships with loved ones! You were _supposed_ to have many sexual relations, fall in love, fall out love, and get drunk with your besties on Friday night! What could possibly be better than this?" But you haven't seen what I've seen. You could never feel what I felt when thinking of my stories. It was like I saw a new dimension of life, something beautiful and strange. Even if every single desire I've ever had emerged from a Freudian principle, I want to believe in that 1%. The 1% that tells me I've found something that really speaks about life, something that makes everything make sense. Where even if I had a netflixesque life, that 1% would be nagging at me, telling me something is missing. If I'm not explaining it well, I'm sorry. I only felt it once, and I don't think the magic will show itself again until I complete those dreams. But just know this: this is my way.

Yes, my life will be difficult. I'll doubt myself, I'll break down because the truth is I hate myself whenever I don't do what I set out to do. But this is my way. This is the only path I can walk down, set in stone ever since I was 16 - no, maybe even before that. But what can get me through this is being grateful. It could be worse. I could be starving. I could be poor. Happiness comes from within. If I can truly believe that, then the path to my dreams doesn't have to be miserable. My way is a path without regret. I must accept I can never be the showstopper - only make them.

I don't want to be a cautionary tale. You ever hear of those kids your mom talks about during breakfast, like, "Brandon, never go on water slides. One kid got his head decapitated, poor thing," or, "never go ice skating on a frozen pool. One kid from Canada drowned and died," you know, those kinds of things? They stop having a real name with real history attached to it. Instead, they become _that French Muslim_ or _that kid in the submarine_.

That's my worst fear. To have my life only mean a warning sign to people, or for my life to not mean anything at all. To have my entire life squished into a single defining event and a decomposing body, as if there were never arms, legs, eyes, and a soul attached to that body in the first place.

What cautionary tale would I be? A person who couldn't achieve their dreams. Like a classic anime protagonist, I knew what I wanted to be ever since I was a teenager. But imagine trying to become the Hokage when you don't have discipline, guts, or an omnipotent demon fox sealed inside of you. That bridge between me current reality and my dreams is a curse, no matter how beautiful my dreams really are.

### The habits

Nothing worthwhile comes in a day, let alone a year. The only way to turn your dreams into reality is to stick with them in the long run. You have the goals, but then you need to break them down into smaller goals - habits.

This is a two step process:

1. Write down the goals
2. Write down the habits you need to turn those goals into reality

#### Goals

- writing three books
- growing to 5"10
- get a 6 pack
- become a one man band
- financial freedom

#### Breaking it down

- Fitness
  - Fish oil and multivitamins in the morning
  - 10,000 steps
  - Track calories (After I eat, I will track calories into myfitnesspal)
  - Gym 5x a week
- Writing
  - writing 1hr a day
  - Writing an article 20 minutes a day
- growing taller
  - 5 min visualization
  - 2 min scripting
  - 7 min stretching day and night. Follow the video
- Discipline and success
  - 5 min anki
  - 5 min quran
  - 10 min meditation
  - 10 min journaling
  - 10 min selling shirt Teepublic
- Music
  - 10 min ear training
  - 1 hr guitar
  - 1 hr piano
  - 30 min bass

### The ideal schedule
