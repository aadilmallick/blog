Mr. Robot is a show with lots of philosophy and uncomfortable truth bombs, often just shoved away in small tirades through Elliot's monologues.

We see him rant about society, about how people are forced to work a job they hate every single day just to stay alive. He directs his anger towards controlling companies who commercialize peoples' struggles, turning every movement into a movie or merchandise.

Those are the scenes everybody talks about, but my favorite was all the way in the last episode.

In Elliot's mind (or in Whiterose's vague machine, as he believes), there are two Elliots living in the same world. The classic doppelganger problem. Elliot decides to figure out who he would've been if his life had been perfect. If he was never disadvantaged with sexual abuse, child abuse, and social anxiety, who would he have become?

The answer baffles Elliot. The ideal Elliot is the exact opposite of the nerdy, ruthless hacker we've come to love over the past 50+ episodes.

Idealliot (that's what I'll call him - corny, I know) is the CEO of allsafe, while Gideon is lost to the inescapable void. He's engaged to Angela, has enough friends to fill a football stadium, has kind, loving parents, and has no mental issues.

He's the exact antithesis of Elliot. Idealliot posts pictures of his happiness on Instagram, plasters it for the world to see how happy and fulfilled he is. This time, Elliot becomes skeptical. He's always tried to find the fatal flaw in others, the one sign that all was not lost. After all, if other people could be flawed, it was okay for him to be scarred as well. It's the one thing he could trust, the one sign that his life wasn't all messed up.

And this was always my favorite part about Elliot. I know it sounds cruel and douchey, but it would be not only unfair, but _unjust_ for a person to have never experienced a negative emotion in their entire life. We put up a veil around ourselves, pretend that we're stronger, more put together than we really are.

Elliot calls us out for what we are. He's busted pedophiles, gamblers, heavy drinkers, adulterists, criminals - all normal, happy people on the surface. His vigilante hacking was always just a device to show what lies beneath the surface of every person - secrets. Behind the Instagram photos we hide our insecurities, and behind wealth we hide our need for validation.

But Elliot can't find Idealliot's demons. Is it really possible for someone to be so happy, for someone to unironically post 8 pictures of their dog and friends every day? His beliefs are about to crumble ... until he finds something.

In probably the weirdest meta twist this season, Idealliot has drawn out the exact story and characters from Mr. Robot, which he should have no knowledge about. Elliot is Idealliot's demon.

When they confront each other, Idealliot admits that while he loves his success, his friends, and his normal life, he often fantasizes about being Elliot, the competent hacker who leads an exciting - yet undeniably tragic - life.

Out of all the scenes in the show, this moment is the one that really spoke to me. Here you have a guy who has it all: the girl, the success, the family, the friends, the respect. He lives the perfect normal life and is the poster child of how to be an asset to society. All Elliot has ever wanted was to be like Idealliot.

But like they say, "the grass is greener on the other side." Idealliot's perfect routine leaves him bored, longing for something greater. We read about people who do the impossible, who lead tragic yet epic lives, both fictional and non-fictional. We can have everything yet still feel like something is missing.

From Elliot's point of view, his own life is unbearable. He's gotten thousands of people killed, and has a debilitating mental condition that can never let him be a normal person. Yet most of us in the audience admire him. We might even come away from the show daydreaming of what it's like to be a competent hacker, taking down conglomerates and giving back to the poor.
