No doubt you've seen some of these before on Twitter, but manga meme edits are a recently popular meme type where people edit the words a character says on a manga panel.

Describing a manga meme edit in your head might sound dry, but when you contrast a character's dialogue with what they're actually doing in the panel, it's anything but unfunny.

Let's take a look at five great manga memes that can get you chuckling - or least exhaling through your nose with more force than average.

## 1. "He's just like me for real"

![chainsaw man meme](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/justlikeme.png)

This meme is from _Chainsaw Man_, a series which took the world by storm in 2021 and 2022. Although this specific panel is later in the series, I'll avoid telling spoilers.

In the original panel, the main character Denji cries of joy because people have taken to the streets to profess their love for Chainsaw Man - Denji's superhero name (even if he's not much of a hero).

This meme is popularly used to respond to relatable tweets. Out of context, it looks like Denji's crying because of the relatability to something, which only makes it that much funnier.

## 2. "It's not too late"

Based on the infamous talk-no-jutsu from Naruto, new memes spawned about Naruto talk-no-jutsuing characters from other anime.

The more evil the villain, the funnier this meme becomes because of the notion that a Blond-haired Shounen protagonist can talk to a villain once and stop all of their evil ways.

There are even more funny variations on this meme, like Naruto trying to convince Eren, Griffith, and even Russian president Vladimir Putin to stop their evil schemes.

## 3. Eren the Master Manipulator

In Attack On Titan, there's a huge reveal in season 4 concerning Eren and his dad Grisha, making Eren out to be one of the most dangerous manipulators of all time. But what about the memes?

Don't worry - they don't disappoint.

Gabi is a character Attack on Titan fans hate because she ... well, I won't go into spoilers. Just know a lot of people dislike her.

So this meme provides hilarious catharsis when Eren manipulates the horse to attack Gabi, to fight for Paradis and chomp off Gabi's hair. In the original panel, the horse bites Gabi's head just for a bit of comic relief, but what makes this meme so funny is how it implies Eren planned this all along, no matter how petty it really is.

## 4. Attack on Titan x Anya

A whole new style of manga meme edits surfaced when Spy x Family blasted in popularity. These memes typically feature one of Anya's signature troll faces and her cameoing in another manga.

In this scene, people replaced Eren with Anya to be Grisha's tormentor and manipulator, creating a bizarre scene that's sure to get a few chuckles out from you.

In some Anya memes, people like to portray her as an omnipotent being, destroying the power scaling in every conceivable anime universe. In this one, Anya is humanity's last hope against the Rumbling.

What could this 3 foot menace possibly do to defeat millions of colossal titans? I don't know, but I would love to find out.

## 5. Anya x Anything

Similar to the previous ones, just inserting Anya in a random manga panel from any series is ridiculous enough to make you laugh.
