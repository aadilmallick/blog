When you want a laugh, your first thought may not be to get it from anime, but I promise you that some of these will have you rolling on the floor. 

So here's 5 quick anime you can watch to have a good time. 

## 1. Saiki K

Saiki K is a show about an all-powerful psychic who grows bored of being all-powerful, and instead decides to live life as an average, powerless human. With his numerous psychic abilities such as teleportation, mind reading, levitation, and x-ray vision, it's interesting to see how he uses his stacked arsenal of powers to avoid situations that would uncover him as a psychic. 

The cast in this show is filled with quirky characters that never get too tiring. Saiki K is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously, and it was intended to make you laugh. So why not try it out? 

## 2. Kaguya Sama: Love is War

Once called the "Death Note of romantic comedies", Kaguya Sama is a show about two characters who are in love with each other, and they both know they like each other. The catch? Neither of them want to be the one to confess first. 

Thankfully Kaguya Sama doesn't labor too much on this premise, and instead it branches out to comedy surrounding its other minor characters. One surprising thing about this series is how modern it really is - one week, some event will happen, and then in the next one it'll be in the manga. This kind of connection to the real world makes you fall in love with the series, not letting you go until the very end. 

## 3. Great Teacher Onizuka

Although pretty old, GTO is a gold mine of comedy because of how explicit it is. This show really holds nothing back. Being 22 years old, Onizuka is a perverse, broke gangster just trying to get some cash and women. He gets the brilliant idea to become a teacher so he can hit on high school girls - the rest is tomfoolery and shenanigans. 

But along the way, he actually becomes a great, caring teacher who teaches his students to become better human beings. And while he'll do some borderline illegal stuff - or just plain illegal - GTO is still a heartwarming yet hilarious story you're sure to enjoy.  

## 4. Konosuba

Konosuba is around the top of everyone's favorite Isekai list for a reason: it makes perfect fun of the genre. Sometimes it mocks the genre intelligently, like how the main character dies because of a lawnmower incident rather than a truck one, but at other times the show is so ridiculous and bizarre that you laugh for no reason. 

Konosuba is something fresh for you if you haven't already seen it. 

## 5. Grand Blue

I'm sure this series needs no introduction, but for those of you who don't know, Grand Blue is a diving anime. Yeah, really. Nothing more. 

Well, at least 2 episodes of it. The rest is underage drinking, naked chestnut tennis, and smuggling illegal weapons into a voice actor convention. Grand Blue is a show about the ideal college life, and every chapter is bound to make you chuckle. 

The anime is great, but the manga stands supreme as the king of all comedy. 

Anyway I hope you enjoy this list and have found something to watch and get a few laughs from.
