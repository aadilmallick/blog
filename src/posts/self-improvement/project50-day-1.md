The Project 50 challenge is a self-improvement challenge designed to change your life in 50 days. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, it probably is, but I'll take anything at this point. I've been in a rut for the past few months, and I'm hoping this challenge will help me get out of it. I'm going to be documenting my progress here, so stay tuned.

# Basic Rules

Below are the rules, but the most important one is this: if you mess up or miss a single day, <i>you have to start from the very beginning</i>. Consistency is key.

1. Wake up before 8 AM.
2. Read 10 pages a day.
3. Exercise 1 hour a day.
4. No junk food.
5. 1 hour of skill learning a day.
6. Do a morning routine
   - For me, this means morning sunlight, anki, stretching, meditation, ear training, a morning run, and journaling.
7. Track daily progress.

# My 10 rules

I've already been doing most of these habits, like meditating, reading, and waking up at 8 AM (I wake up at 6), so I'm going to be adding a few more rules to make this more applicable to me and actually spark some change. For other rules, I've actually been super close, like how I do boxing and running pretty much everyday, but I'll occasionally indulge in junk food once a month or so. But the baseline is this: _I've been too half-@ssed about everything_. I need dead-on consistency. Nothing else will cut it. So here are my rules:

1. Wake up before 8 AM.
2. Read 10 pages a day.
3. Exercise 1 hour a day.
4. No junk food.
5. 1 hour of skill learning a day.
6. Do a morning routine
   - For me, this means morning sunlight, anki, stretching, meditation, ear training, a morning run, and journaling.
7. Track daily progress.
8. Piano practice for 1 hour a day.
9. Guitar practice for 1 hour a day.
10. Bass practice for 30 minutes a day.
