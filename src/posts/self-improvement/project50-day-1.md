Today is day 1 of the project 50 challenge. I'm going to be documenting my progress here, so stay tuned.

# Basic Rules

Below are the rules, but the most important one is this: if you mess up or miss a single day, <i>you have to start from the very beginning</i>. Consistency is key.

1. Wake up before 8 AM.
2. Read 10 pages a day.
3. Exercise 1 hour a day.
4. No junk food.
5. 1 hour of skill learning a day.
6. Do a morning routine
   - For me, this means morning sunlight, anki, stretching, meditation, ear training, a morning run, and journaling.
7. Track daily progress.

# Day 1 summary

> Day 1 complete

Honestly, I didn't feel great today. It's not like the challenge was hard or anything, but it didn't feel like a drastic change from anything else I was already doing. Case in point: let's go over the rules together:

1. **Wake up before 8 AM✅**: I already wake up at 6 AM, which honestly isn't even that hard. Huberman's morning sunlight tip is a godsend.
2. **Morning routine✅**: Already had a morning routine in place. The only difference was that I avoided doing it on the weekends, but the main point still stands: I deleted all social media, so I don't use my phone unproductively anymore.
3. **Exercise 1 hour a day✅**: I was actually looking forward to this one, but I messed it up on the first day. Well, not really. I didn't do my workout today - I was hoping to hit chest and abs - but I did do a morning run, boxing, some walking, and squats. I was surprised I hit this goal, given that I didn't really do much today, but those 63 active minutes on my fitbit don't lie.
4. **Read 10 pages a day✅**: Reading was never difficult for me. Unless it was for school, reading was nothing but fun. Honestly, I have to _stop_ myself from reading, just because too much reading and not enough doing is unproductive. What I really need to do is to find a way to apply what I read, and remember it.
5. **1hr skill learning✅**: Too easy. I strive to practice my instruments for 3 hours a day (although that number is only 1 in reality) but I also get in my 3-4 hours of coding. I live for skill learning. Too bad it doesn't feel fun anymore.
6. **No junk food✅**: A bit harder, but there's no junk in my house anyway so I never feel tempted to eat stuff. It's kind of remarkable how I didn't feel hungry when I did exercise today. Exercise really does inhibit appetite, contrary to common sense.
7. **Track daily progress✅**: I'm doing that right now. Well, I need to go more in depth with this, like doing my daily journaling and recording my practice in my music journal.

## What I accomplished

- **Read 20 pages of the 1% rule**. I have only one chapter left. Although I wanted this book to be that one last book I need before I can actually get up and do something with my life, it didn't turn out that way. But in a way, that's exactly the point. The main idea of the book is that you need to take action, and you can't wait for anyone else to push you towards your dream.
- **Finished svg course on udemy**: I learned a bit about how to animate svgs, and that drawing svgs in an animation is actually kind of simple, and involves tampering with the `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties. But in the grand scheme of the universe, does that even matter? No. The answer is obviously no.
- **Finished Enviato Tuts web dev course**: Pretty nice course. I learned a few things about color theory and figma. But the real big guy here is the man himself Vako. I need to finish his web design course. He's just that guy. I don't know how to explain it. He's just that guy.

What I want to accomplish this week:

- Finish UPS react native app
- Publish dr stone tab to youtube, publish fortnite tab to youtube
