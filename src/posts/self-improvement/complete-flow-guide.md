## What is Flow?

Flow is a state of complete focus. You are not thinking about anything else - the only things that exist in the universe is you and the activity.

Flow state is the absolute peak of human existence, the true source of happiness we should all chase. It might be hard to believe, but a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.

Even when we have leisure time, we'll be unhappy because we'll be lost in thought. We're actually less happy in free time than work. The anti-work culture is overblown. Doing things that make our minds work hard is more fun and ultimately more rewarding than full-on leisure.

We often have this image in our minds of a person drinking a beer while on a tropical beach, living the life. We think that's the pinnacle of existence, but that person is thinking something different: _man, I can't wait to go home so I can start working on that new business idea_.

The tropical beach fantasy might seem like the end goal in life, but imagine living that dream for more than a month. An entire month on the beach starts to get boring now, doesn't it? No more new fish to discover, You've walked along the same shore a thousand times, and the washed-up shells don't interest you anymore. It's supposed to happen. As humans, we _habituate_ to things, which is a fancy way of saying we get used to stuff.

No matter if you buy that new car, new house, or new private island, bottom line is you'll get used to it. Suddenly your money isn't so appealing anymore.

The solution? Flow. To be undeniably present in the moment, as if nothing else in the universe existed - that is what it the peak of existence is. Monks have known about this for centuries.

So don't chase the material success. Even if you're a millionaire, one day you'll wake up and realize that nothing's really changed. Warren Buffet once described his average day as boring - nothing but reading and business.

It confirms what I've thought for a while now - life isn't a movie, but rather a series of days. Happiness is internal.

So what makes us happy? It's actually the simple things:

- Diet
- Exercise
- Spending time with loved ones

### Actionable Step

1. Write down your goals

I'll go first: 

- Create an anime called Tomura, which is a sequel to Naruto 
- Create a show called TIme Warriors
- Create a show and write a book called The Dream
- Create a youtube channel named One Man Band where I upload covers of my favorite songs, playing guitar, piano, bass, and merging all the audio together - hence the name One Man Band. I want to get 1 million subscribers on that channel. 
- Tall and fit

2. Notice your goals and realize what flow activities you'll have to do to achieve them. Are most of them activities you dislike? Are they flow state activities? 

- Writing is a flow state activity for me. I should do more of it. 
- Practicing piano and guitar are not flow state activities for me, since I frequently mind-wander when practicing. But they are non-negotiable tasks, so I better figure out a way to make them enjoyable. 

## How to get into flow state

Here are a list of flow blockers and how to solve them: 

>parents and family disturbing you

Just tell your family you're about to enter a deep work situation and ask them not to disturb you. 

>Task switching

Do not do task switching. It resets your focus back to 0. Use the Forest app to prevent going to other sites. 

>carbs

In the morning, do not eat carbs. They make your body lethargic and sluggy. Instead eat a breakfast rich in protein and fats. 

>distractions

Put your phone on airplane mode. Non-negotiable.

The next step is to create a **flow state ritual**, which prepares you for a session of flow. The optimal flow ritual is something that eliminates as much decision-making as possible, so you can go into autopilot and focus solely on executing the work. 

Here is what my flow state ritual is going to be like: 
- [ ] Grab and fill a glass of water, take it upstairs 
- [ ] Go to the bathroom if you need to
- [ ] Write down the task you are going to do, why you're doing it, and how it connects to your long-term vision
- [ ] Do the Huberman focus routine: stare at a single point in space on your screen for 1 minute. 
- [ ] Start the timer, setup the forest app to block other sites. Then start the work
