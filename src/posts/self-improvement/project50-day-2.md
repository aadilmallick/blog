Today is day 2 of the project 50 challenge. I'm going to be documenting my progress here, so stay tuned.

# Basic Rules

Below are the rules, but the most important one is this: if you mess up or miss a single day, <i>you have to start from the very beginning</i>. Consistency is key.

1. Wake up before 8 AM.
2. Read 10 pages a day.
3. Exercise 1 hour a day.
4. No junk food.
5. 1 hour of skill learning a day.
6. Do a morning routine
   - For me, this means morning sunlight, anki, stretching, meditation, ear training, a morning run, and journaling.
7. Track daily progress.

# Day 2 summary

> Day 2 complete

Same old, same old. To be honest, I don't think this project will change my life since it's already to similar to what I do. So I might change the rules a bit. At least for now, I just have to finish the month of June, and then I'll be free. I realize this line of thinking is harmful, saying _the time isn't right, I swear_, but to be honest, the time just isn't right. So when July starts, I have to go turbo mode.

But for now, let's go over how I did with the rules.

1. **Wake up before 8 AM✅**: Woke up at 6. Honestly, a bit earlier, so I'm sleep deprived.
2. **Morning routine✅**: I missed my morning run today because I was afraid of people. It's stupid, I know, but for some reason my brain keeps making me overfantasize about these improbable situations where people laugh at me for running while they're walking. I need a mindset shift.
3. **Exercise 1 hour a day✅**: Somehow got 1 hr even though I only did boxing. I guess I shouldn't wear my fitbit while playing the piano.
4. **Read 10 pages a day✅**: yup
5. **1hr skill learning✅**: I get too caught up in learning skills that don't matter or ones that don't follow the 80/20 rule. But coding is so darn fun.
6. **No junk food✅**: I felt a little bit of temptation today to eat cornbread, but then I remembered this challenge. So at least it's good for something. But to be honest, the _no junk food_ won't make a difference unless I exercise a lot.
7. **Track daily progress✅**: I'm doing that right now. Well, I need to go more in depth with this, like doing my daily journaling and recording my practice in my music journal.

## What I accomplished

- **Finished the 1% rule**: I really don't want this book to just become entertainment. Tomorrow for my deep work daily highlight session, I'm going to spend half an hour reviewing this book and writing down TODOs I can implement.
- **Gave up on the UPS app** : I wouldn't call this an accomplishment, but I'm kind of tired of graphql. I don't need to do an entire project with it, so I'm skipping this app. But I crossed it off the list of June goals. ONly webdesign vako and the in-app-subscriptions app left.

What I want to accomplish this week/TODOS:

- Finish in-app-subscriptions app sonny sangha
- Publish dr stone tab to youtube, publish fortnite tab to youtube
