## You aren't successful because you care too much - Dan Koe

The only way to get success is to generate self-confidence. Then only way to get self-confidence is to stop caring what other people think of you.

So here are the 4 steps to get that self-confidence:

1. Perspective: analyze the situation calmly and from an outside view
2. Perception: realize that the situation is not as bad as you think it is. It helps you get opportunities.
3. Practice: make sure your waking hours are devoted to skill acquisition
4. Authenticity: Do what you want without worrying about pushback from others.

### Perspective

Whenever you are in a situation that sparks anxiety, follow these three steps:

1. Zoom out to see the situation for what it is, something normal, something unserious.
2. Transfer consciousness to other people in the room, and realize that they are also just people, and they are also just trying to get through the day. Adopt another person's perspective.

You have to understand everyone is a normal person. Treat them as such. Stop placing people above and below you.

### Perception

You don't have to shy. Remember that the majority of people are going to have positive interactions with you and will want to talk with you in a nice way.

You have to take the first step and make yourself open to opportunities and talking. Present yourself as a welcoming person.

### Practice

Skill acquisition is a way to level up in the game of life.

You should not even _consider_ doing anything that will not level up your life or is not skill acquisition. The only exception is watching Netflix at **night** when winding down.

### All together

You must become a creator. Humans thrive in the challenge of creation. You must create something that is your own.

This is the unconventional path to life. Instead of becoming a normal, average person at age 25, you risk it all to become someone greater.

Below is a continual progression path for self improvement:

- Build your mind with books, self-reflection, and writing
- Build your body with exercise, nutrient-dense foods, and long walks
- Build your business with skill acquisition, problem-solving, and self-promotion.

If you do all three of these things each day, you become multidimensionally "jacked". You become a person that is a force to be reckoned with. It's the path to the good life.

The cure to anxiety is curiosity. You must be curious about the world and the people in it. You must be curious about yourself and your own mind. Focus on the present, right here, right now.

Here are some todos that we can all take from this video. Change them into your own.

- [ ] When in an anxious situation, zoom out and look at it from a third person perspective.
- [ ] When in an anxious situation, adopt the situation from another person's perspective.
- [ ] Be conscious of how you present yourself. Make sure you are welcoming to other people rather than intimidating.
- [ ] During the day, make sure you are not doing anything that doesn't level up your life. Only participate in mind-numbing activities in the night to wind down.

## Overstimulation

</div>

you watch Netflix and do social media because you are living a life you want to escape from. The only way to overcome this addiction is to create a life you don't want to escape from.

Remember that each time you indulge in these activities, you are taking away from your future self's happiness. Each of these vices is nothing more than trying to escape emotional pain.

Look at it for what it is. You're not watching YouTube or scrolling on Instagram because you want to. You're doing it because you want to escape from the emotional pain of your current life.

No one is coming to save you, to stop you from watching YouTube and to make you get up and put work into your goals. Nobody. Only you can save yourself. So whenever you don't feel like doing work, remember that nobody else will tell you to work. Only you can. So get up and do it.
