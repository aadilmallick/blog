## You aren't successful because you care too much - Dan Koe

The only way to get success is to generate self-confidence. Then only way to get self-confidence is to stop caring what other people think of you.

So here are the 4 steps to get that self-confidence:

1. Perspective: analyze the situation calmly and from an outside view
2. Perception: realize that the situation is not as bad as you think it is. It helps you get opportunities.
3. Practice: make sure your waking hours are devoted to skill acquisition
4. Authenticity: Do what you want without worrying about pushback from others.

### Perspective

Whenever you are in a situation that sparks anxiety, follow these three steps:

1. Zoom out to see the situation for what it is, something normal, something unserious.
2. Transfer consciousness to other people in the room, and realize that they are also just people, and they are also just trying to get through the day. Adopt another person's perspective.

You have to understand everyone is a normal person. Treat them as such. Stop placing people above and below you.

### Perception

You don't have to shy. Remember that the majority of people are going to have positive interactions with you and will want to talk with you in a nice way.

You have to take the first step and make yourself open to opportunities and talking. Present yourself as a welcoming person.

### Practice

Skill acquisition is a way to level up in the game of life.

You should not even _consider_ doing anything that will not level up your life or is not skill acquisition. The only exception is watching Netflix at **night** when winding down.

### All together

You must become a creator. Humans thrive in the challenge of creation. You must create something that is your own.

This is the unconventional path to life. Instead of becoming a normal, average person at age 25, you risk it all to become someone greater.

Below is a continual progression path for self improvement:

- Build your mind with books, self-reflection, and writing
- Build your body with exercise, nutrient-dense foods, and long walks
- Build your business with skill acquisition, problem-solving, and self-promotion.

If you do all three of these things each day, you become multidimensionally "jacked". You become a person that is a force to be reckoned with. It's the path to the good life.

The cure to anxiety is curiosity. You must be curious about the world and the people in it. You must be curious about yourself and your own mind. Focus on the present, right here, right now.

Here are some todos that we can all take from this video. Change them into your own.

- [ ] When in an anxious situation, zoom out and look at it from a third person perspective.
- [ ] When in an anxious situation, adopt the situation from another person's perspective.
- [ ] Be conscious of how you present yourself. Make sure you are welcoming to other people rather than intimidating.
- [ ] During the day, make sure you are not doing anything that doesn't level up your life. Only participate in mind-numbing activities in the night to wind down.

## Overstimulation

</div>

you watch Netflix and do social media because you are living a life you want to escape from. The only way to overcome this addiction is to create a life you don't want to escape from.

Remember that each time you indulge in these activities, you are taking away from your future self's happiness. Each of these vices is nothing more than trying to escape emotional pain.

Look at it for what it is. You're not watching YouTube or scrolling on Instagram because you want to. You're doing it because you want to escape from the emotional pain of your current life.

No one is coming to save you, to stop you from watching YouTube and to make you get up and put work into your goals. Nobody. Only you can save yourself. So whenever you don't feel like doing work, remember that nobody else will tell you to work. Only you can. So get up and do it.

## How to fix your life

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dw6hn8aisIY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Productivity mindset

To fix your life, you must become a **producer rather than consumer**. Once you start taking action, you can begin to fix your life. You won't have time to dive into the abyss of consumption. 

You should start thinking of your time as valuable. The average salary in America is $33.58, while we waste about 3 hours a day on average on social media and watching tv. So the total cost of wasting time everyday is **$101.29**. That's a lot. 

For financial situations, make sure to use 50% of your money for living expenses, 30% for leisure and personal stuff, and save the other 20% in a savings account. 

When faced with a hard choice and an easy choice, always take the hard choice. Facing our fears makes us mentally stronger. Anything worth it in life will always take hard work, hard work we don't want to do because we're wired to like the easy stuff. Don't be like that. Rise above and do the hard things where other people won't. 

Actionable step: 

- [ ] Write out the figure $101.29 next to you everyday, so you are reminded of the cost of wasting time. 
- [ ] When faced with a hard choice and an easy choice, think to yourself, "I will do the hard thing even if I don't feel like it because other people won't do this, but I will. This hard thing will make me stronger and will be better for me in the long run."

### Think positive

The second part of fixing your life is to prime your brain to think positively of yourself. Here are some actionable steps you can follow: 

- [ ] Get a haircut. Studies show when we haven't got haircut in a long time, we become depressed. 
- [ ] Put on fragrance. Studies show women (and most importantly, yourself) rate you higher when you smell good. 
- [ ] Wear formal attire. It increases your self-esteem. 



### Daily tips 

- Do 25 pushups every hour on the hour
- take a 10 minute nature walk to reduce cortisol
- eat your vitamin D
- Have a workout log or app. Make sure to do progressive overload. You need to track every single workout. 

### Become a part of the 1%

1. become **fit**. You'll know you've reached it by getting a 6 pack. 
2. Dress well. Get a haircut once a month. 
3. Have a purpose. Stay masculine and stoic by not getting into online arguments. People who truly have a purpose worth pursuing will not waste their time on the internet. 
4. Be disciplined.
	 - [ ] Force yourself to not eat junk food. 
	 - [ ] Force yourself to go to the gym 
 5. Develop an insane work ethic. Understand that the only way to be successful is to do what the 99% won't do, which is soul-crushing work. Everyone will think of you as weird. Keep going, because they can't see what you see. You see something at the end. So keep going. You will be a slave to yourself for your entire life if you do not have discipline. 

### Perfect Daily Routine

1. Wake up 
2. Drink 3 glasses of water
3. Get 10 minutes of morning sunlight
4. Do 10 rounds of 10 pullups, 20 pushups, and 30 squats, all as fast as possible. 
5. Do the rule of 3: Write out all your todos in the day, and circle the three most important ones. Do those first.
