Being a productivity fiend who hasn't had a yoctogram (10^-24th of a gram) of success, I bear a striking resemblance to the Red Skull. 

He's the bald-headed - and can't forget red - Marvel villain everyone forgets, but I'll always remember him because of that one meme with him and Thanos: 

> "I guide others to a treasure I cannot possess" - Red Skull

For every 100 productivity junkies hooked on the dream of success, only one actually achieves it. 1%. We hear people say that figure, and we smile. We dream of it. We know it belongs to us. 

**But we've forgotten how astronomically small 1% really is.** 

We've scoffed at Covid's 3% death rate and even more so for flu's 1%. Rather than think that for every 100 million people with the flu, a million could die, we'd prefer to believe we're invincible. 

After all, it's only 1%.

But when we hear about the people at the top, the 1% enjoying their lives in luxury, we think *that'll be me one day.*

How I wish we were right. 

## How difficult becoming part of the 1% really is

- Less than 10% of people in the US are over 6 feet tall. 
- If you're a man, only 11% of you guys have 6 packs ([sketchy source](https://www.thedonutwhole.com/how-many-men-have-six-packs/)).
- Only 17% of people in the US have a 6 figure salary and above. 

Multiplying all those independent events together (I hope you remember your probability classes), there's only 0.1% of people living in the US that meet these criteria. 

Despite the millions of people you see on Instagram everyday that have these desirable qualities, is the percentage really that small? These stats have to be wrong, right? 

Well, they could be. I honestly think the percentage is even lower than what it is right now. 

You only feel like the 1% is common - even when it objectively isn't - because the 1% is **loud**. It's in their nature for the people on top to be loud, famous, and ever-present. 

Because we **notice** the guy with the 6 pack. We **notice** the guy with lambo. What we don't see are the 100 other guys hidden behind his shadow - the McDonald workers, garbage truck drivers, and Amazon delivery guys. 

Only 8.86% of all YouTube channels have over 1000 subscribers. For 10,000 - the coveted sub-1%.

For every loud 1%, we have the quiet 99. There's more of them than you can imagine. 

Don't fall into the trap of rushing to become part of the 1%. If you rush, you cut corners. If you cut corners, you fail to do the real work that gets you success. 

This first step to success - according to an unsuccessful guy - is to break the illusion of the 1%. Yes, it may seem like 10 LA girls per $105m^2$ post tiktoks and earn 318K per month. But it's just them **being loud**.
