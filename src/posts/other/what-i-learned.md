## The philosophy

## 2025

## February

**2/16/2025**

- **three things I learned today**:
	1. Soup tastes better with a 4:2 broth to water ratio
	2. Chicken does not cook in soup. You need to thoroughly cook stuff like chicken and onions before you put it into soup. 
	3. Christopher Columbus was not a "lucky idiot." What he did with limited technology actually required a lot of skill
- **three questions about the world:**
	1. How can you prove Christianity is correct over Islam? What proof is there that Jesus is God and that the belief in the Trinity somehow isn't the most confusing thing ever?
	2. What did trade look like back in history? How great was it?
	3. How did organic life form from inorganic nonlife?
- **three things I want to understand more:**
	1. Confucianism
	2. Buddhism
	3. Seerah
